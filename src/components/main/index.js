             In-person vs. Remote most of the time this is decided by need and capability.
              We have the ability maintain team organization and collaborations remotely if prefered.  
              Our Technical writers will work with the client and staff on solution implementation.
              We also help prepare custom presentations for leadership. Xmlâ€™s technical writers ensure 
              the client understands their solutions inside and out.
